&lt;p&gt;Machine learning methods, simple and complex, can be used in almost all aspects of our digital lives.  Interestingly enough, it is rarely observed in the offensive side of information security.  When I was thinking about the number of ways an attacker can exfiltrate data past a firewall, I decided to try out an old favorite, Markov chains, in order to build the next generation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_cipher&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;book ciphers&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;markov-chains-as-a-keyed-obfuscation-method:84e7421e24ba41f3bed9835a932084c9&#34;&gt;Markov Chains as a Keyed Obfuscation Method&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a project that has been sitting in my private git repository for a long while, and after I was recently reminded of it, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write it up and do an initial release.  The premise of the project is to use Markov chains in order to obfuscate binary information to appear similar to written language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel it&amp;rsquo;d probably be good for me to mention this fairly early on&amp;hellip;I AM NOT A DATA SCIENTIST!  I enjoy using machine learning where I can, but I have no formal training in it, and I am not a data scientist at my employer.  I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely a data science amateur, but what machine learning I do know, I have found it to be extremely useful.  On another note, I highly suggest that anyone reading this should spend some time to learn some basic machine learning concepts at some point.  It is an extremely useful tool to have in your toolbelt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;markov-chains:84e7421e24ba41f3bed9835a932084c9&#34;&gt;Markov Chains&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone not familiar with Markov chains, they are very commonly used in conversational bots.  For example, there are a number of bots on Twitter which emulate people.  For instance, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/da_667&#34;&gt;@da_667&lt;/a&gt; has setup &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/667__ebooks&#34;&gt;@667__ebooks&lt;/a&gt; as a bot which impersonates @da_667 based on what he&amp;rsquo;s said on Twitter in the past.  Presumably, this bot is using Markov chains, which have been generated with his past Twitter feed to generate messages such as this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;my theory: colonel sanders isn&amp;#39;t dead because he&amp;#39;s worked for javascript.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 667&lt;strong&gt;ebooks (@667&lt;/strong&gt;ebooks) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/667__ebooks/status/667718905012600836&#34;&gt;November 20, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this appears to be English, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t entirely make sense (but still amusing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way most Markov chains operate is in two phases: Learning and Generating.  Markov chains can also be used to &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; input, in order to determine how likely a sentence was to have been generated from the source, but that is not relevant to this post.  In the Learning phase, the Markov engine is fed a data set (a set of sentences) which were generated by the source being emulated.  The engine then breaks these sentences down into words, and calculates the chance that each word will follow every other word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;markov.learn([&amp;quot;im on fire&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;im going to die&amp;quot;])

            im   on  fire going to die
im          0    .5  0    .5    0  0
on          0    0   1    0     0  0
fire        0    0   0    0     0  0
going       0    0   0    0     1  0
to          0    0   0    0     0  1
die         0    0   0    0     0  0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this can be a real pain to do by hand, it is really easy to gather information like this in code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in the generation phase, the Markov engine will pick the most likely word to follow the current word in order to pick the next word in the sentence to tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both phases, I have simplified the description, and some implementations can grow to be significantly more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-markov-chains-to-our-advantage:84e7421e24ba41f3bed9835a932084c9&#34;&gt;Using Markov Chains to Our Advantage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given our previous knowledge of how Markov chains work, we can potentially use this knowledge to create an obfuscated stream of data which appears like English (or any other language we feel like using).  The concept is as follows: Instead of using the most likely word to follow our current word, we use the Nth most likely word to follow, where N represents a single byte we are trying to send.  This does require that both sides have the same Markov model, but this isn&amp;rsquo;t much of an issue, as it only requires both sides to have read the same &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; or set of sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;current_word = &amp;quot;apple&amp;quot;
sorted_list_of_words_following_apple = [
    &amp;quot;sucks&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;over-charges&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;sauce&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;cider&amp;quot;,
    ...
]
byte_to_represent = 0x2

print current_word + &amp;quot; &amp;quot; + sorted_list_of_words_following_apple[byte_to_represent]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is a possible issue where our &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; will not generate enough word comparisons to give us enough information to represent a full 8 bit value.  In order to recover from this, we can spread the value out over multiple words, and require that each byte must be represented by available values of at least 256.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;proof-of-concept:84e7421e24ba41f3bed9835a932084c9&#34;&gt;Proof of Concept&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may have imagined, I have built a proof of concept for this.  It is in pure Python 2, and should be quite simple to integrate into Python based projects.  If you working in a language other than Python&amp;hellip;good luck.  But seriously, hopefully you can read enough Python to reimplement based on the supplied code and this blog post.  Additionally, if you implement this in another programming language or at all, please feel to let me know on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/botnet_hunter&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Markov engines fed with War and Peace, thanks to Project Gutenberg.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As any reader should be able to tell, no sane person typed the obfuscated string, but it could be quite difficult for a naive algorithm (working at scale) to be even remotely close to being able to tell that this information was obfuscated, much less what the underlying data was.  Interestingly enough, since we have some room for randomization (based on the first word chosen), each time the message is obfuscated, it can be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be noticing that the obfuscated version can be significantly longer than the original data.  This is an unfortunate side effect, but it can be helped in some cases using compression before the data is obfuscated.  The compression method used doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter, as long as it is the same on both sides.  Additionally, if the transport method being used supports compression, ASCII text tends to compress quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-cases:84e7421e24ba41f3bed9835a932084c9&#34;&gt;Use Cases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few use cases for this that come to mind.  The first is the method it was developed to prove, exfiltrating data past a firewall.  Considering that the obfuscated data is text, it could even be sent out in emails without triggering an alert based on content, written to a Google Drive document, or simply POSTed via HTTP.  Similarly, it could be a simple command and control channel, as it would be very simple to POST data to an HTTP/IRC/etc server and receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could potentially be used to obfuscate other communication channels as well.  For instance, a method like this could be a positive addition to instant messaging plugin such as OTR, as it could hide the fact that there were encrypted communications.  Due to recent world events, and not wishing to support radical movements even indirectly, I won&amp;rsquo;t be releasing such plugin or improvement, and hoping that they suck even worse at coding than they do at hacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;detection:84e7421e24ba41f3bed9835a932084c9&#34;&gt;Detection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detecting this method could be considerably difficult.  Much like most other issues on the blue team side of things, the greatest issue is related to detecting something at scale.  From a network firewall perspective, there would need to be parsing of all text, which would then need to be statistically analyzed and compared to Markov language models to see if the data strongly fit.  To be absolutely honest, it would require someone with considerably more skill than myself in machine learning (like any one of the actual data scientists at Cylance) in order to handle this kind of detection at scale without a significant number of false positives and false negatives. I do wish I had a better answer to detect this method, but right now, I do not.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Detecting shellcode over the network with scapy and libemu</title>
      <link>https://bwall.github.io/libemu-scapy-for-shellcode-on-the-network/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I will describe a method of using libemu along with scapy in order to detect shellcode being sent across the network in unencrypted channels.  This method would not be particularly reasonable for large networks without a significant amount of computing power.  On the other hand, for semi-automated analysis, or even integration into something like Cuckoo Sandbox, it may be quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this proof of concept is currently functional, it would take some work on the project&amp;rsquo;s dependencies in order for me to consider the project a success.  I have not yet decided if I plan on dedicating significant time to resolving issues in the related projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;network-detection-of-shellcode:f0f2ac46c551efb82181805b8d37429b&#34;&gt;Network Detection of Shellcode&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to detect this shellcode, we need a few major components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Method to detect shellcode in a buffer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Method to acquire network packets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Method to assembly socket communication over the network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first requirement, we simply use libemu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the remaining requirements, we use scapy and some additional Python code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;libemu:f0f2ac46c551efb82181805b8d37429b&#34;&gt;libemu&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libemu is a library for detecting and emulating shellcode, allowing for some automated analysis of shellcode.  Unfortunately, it does not appear to be under active development, and getting up to date source code is currently alluding me. It also appears to have a few bugs, some of which make it less viable for integration into network perimeter defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with it being difficult to locate the source, the current libemu interfaces to libemu in Python both seem to have some issues.  While both python-libemu and pylibemu are very useful, python-libemu fails to implement many of the features of libemu, and pylibemu currently has some issues which seriously impact memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found that even via the Python interfaces, an arbitrary buffer supplied to libemu for processing can lead to a floating point error, which will crash the process.  This is one reason I do not suggest running this in production environments, or on large enterprise networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our purposes, we&amp;rsquo;ll use python-libemu, installed on Ubuntu with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install python-libemu
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;scapy:f0f2ac46c551efb82181805b8d37429b&#34;&gt;scapy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scapy is well known as a raw networking library for Python, and being pretty awesome.  I&amp;rsquo;m not going to spend time covering Scapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo pip install scapy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis:f0f2ac46c551efb82181805b8d37429b&#34;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to scan over these packets in a similar way that the attacker would send them, we need to create the socket streams.  More specifically, we need to look at each direction of communication.  Additionally, we don&amp;rsquo;t want all of every stream in memory at the same time, so we use a LRUCache (from cachetools) to keep the most recent streams in memory, and use a memory buffering technique called a sliding window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sliding window, we set the max amount of memory we want to use per stream, then as we get new data, we append the new data, then cut off bytes in the beginning of our buffer until it is smaller than our max buffer size.  This way we can look at all the data, and avoid simply looking at each packet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each new packet we get, we scan the sliding window buffer with libemu.  If libemu detects shellcode, we print the offset and the quad (ip:port-ip:port).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;code:f0f2ac46c551efb82181805b8d37429b&#34;&gt;Code&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not update the code in this blog post, but if I need to, I will update the code in the following gist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/bwall/9cba618eacedc68c656b&#34;&gt;Network Shellcode Detection Proof of Concept&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the proof of concept, the shellcode detection is being done across every thread on the local computer.  This is done because libemu scanning scan be quite CPU intensive and slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PoC requires the following commands before being installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install python-libemu python-pip
sudo pip install scapy
sudo pip install cachetools
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
