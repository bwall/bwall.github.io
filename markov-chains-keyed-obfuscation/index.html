<p>Machine learning methods, simple and complex, can be used in almost all aspects of our digital lives.  Interestingly enough, it is rarely observed in the offensive side of information security.  When I was thinking about the number of ways an attacker can exfiltrate data past a firewall, I decided to try out an old favorite, Markov chains, in order to build the next generation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_cipher">&ldquo;book ciphers&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h1 id="update:84e7421e24ba41f3bed9835a932084c9"><em>UPDATE</em></h1>

<p>A Github repository has been created for this project: <a href="https://github.com/bwall/markovobfuscate">markovobfuscate</a></p>

<h1 id="markov-chains-as-a-keyed-obfuscation-method:84e7421e24ba41f3bed9835a932084c9">Markov Chains as a Keyed Obfuscation Method</h1>

<p>This is a project that has been sitting in my private git repository for a long while, and after I was recently reminded of it, I&rsquo;ve decided to write it up and do an initial release.  The premise of the project is to use Markov chains in order to obfuscate binary information to appear similar to written language.</p>

<p>I feel it&rsquo;d probably be good for me to mention this fairly early on&hellip;I AM NOT A DATA SCIENTIST!  I enjoy using machine learning where I can, but I have no formal training in it, and I am not a data scientist at my employer.  I&rsquo;m absolutely a data science amateur, but what machine learning I do know, I have found it to be extremely useful.  On another note, I highly suggest that anyone reading this should spend some time to learn some basic machine learning concepts at some point.  It is an extremely useful tool to have in your toolbelt.</p>

<h2 id="markov-chains:84e7421e24ba41f3bed9835a932084c9">Markov Chains</h2>

<p>For anyone not familiar with Markov chains, they are very commonly used in conversational bots.  For example, there are a number of bots on Twitter which emulate people.  For instance, <a href="https://twitter.com/da_667">@da_667</a> has setup <a href="https://twitter.com/667__ebooks">@667__ebooks</a> as a bot which impersonates @da_667 based on what he&rsquo;s said on Twitter in the past.  Presumably, this bot is using Markov chains, which have been generated with his past Twitter feed to generate messages such as this:</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">my theory: colonel sanders isn&#39;t dead because he&#39;s worked for javascript.</p>&mdash; 667<strong>ebooks (@667</strong>ebooks) <a href="https://twitter.com/667__ebooks/status/667718905012600836">November 20, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>While this appears to be English, it doesn&rsquo;t entirely make sense (but still amusing).</p>

<p>The way most Markov chains operate is in two phases: Learning and Generating.  Markov chains can also be used to &ldquo;fit&rdquo; input, in order to determine how likely a sentence was to have been generated from the source, but that is not relevant to this post.  In the Learning phase, the Markov engine is fed a data set (a set of sentences) which were generated by the source being emulated.  The engine then breaks these sentences down into words, and calculates the chance that each word will follow every other word.</p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>markov.learn([&quot;im on fire&quot;, &quot;im going to die&quot;])

            im   on  fire going to die
im          0    .5  0    .5    0  0
on          0    0   1    0     0  0
fire        0    0   0    0     0  0
going       0    0   0    0     1  0
to          0    0   0    0     0  1
die         0    0   0    0     0  0
</code></pre>

<p>While this can be a real pain to do by hand, it is really easy to gather information like this in code.</p>

<p>When in the generation phase, the Markov engine will pick the most likely word to follow the current word in order to pick the next word in the sentence to tweet.</p>

<p>For both phases, I have simplified the description, and some implementations can grow to be significantly more complicated.</p>

<h2 id="using-markov-chains-to-our-advantage:84e7421e24ba41f3bed9835a932084c9">Using Markov Chains to Our Advantage</h2>

<p>Given our previous knowledge of how Markov chains work, we can potentially use this knowledge to create an obfuscated stream of data which appears like English (or any other language we feel like using).  The concept is as follows: Instead of using the most likely word to follow our current word, we use the Nth most likely word to follow, where N represents a single byte we are trying to send.  This does require that both sides have the same Markov model, but this isn&rsquo;t much of an issue, as it only requires both sides to have read the same &ldquo;book&rdquo; or set of sentences.</p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>current_word = &quot;apple&quot;
sorted_list_of_words_following_apple = [
    &quot;sucks&quot;,
    &quot;over-charges&quot;,
    &quot;sauce&quot;,
    &quot;cider&quot;,
    ...
]
byte_to_represent = 0x2

print current_word + &quot; &quot; + sorted_list_of_words_following_apple[byte_to_represent]
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, there is a possible issue where our &ldquo;book&rdquo; will not generate enough word comparisons to give us enough information to represent a full 8 bit value.  In order to recover from this, we can spread the value out over multiple words, and require that each byte must be represented by available values of at least 256.</p>

<h2 id="proof-of-concept:84e7421e24ba41f3bed9835a932084c9">Proof of Concept</h2>

<p>As you may have imagined, I have built a proof of concept for this.  It is in pure Python 2, and should be quite simple to integrate into Python based projects.  If you working in a language other than Python&hellip;good luck!  But seriously, hopefully you can read enough Python to reimplement based on the supplied code and this blog post.  Additionally, if you implement this in another programming language or at all, please feel to let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/botnet_hunter">Twitter</a> or something.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<pre><code># Markov engines fed with War and Peace, thanks to Project Gutenberg.

<p>As any reader should be able to tell, no sane person typed the obfuscated string, but it could be quite difficult for a naive algorithm (working at scale) to be even remotely close to being able to tell that this information was obfuscated, much less what the underlying data was.  Interestingly enough, since we have some room for randomization (based on the first word chosen), each time the message is obfuscated, it can be different.</p>

said denisov who i got off their minds will hardly heard the same path in view the third officer comes from him do wish her to herself

began walking in russian nobility and it gave instructions and still young girl she's pretty young men should long dresses into this 
field where napoleon his attention to cry when two very clear bold features was a boy you he wore medals both of genius every other

besides humiliation .  rostov said tikhon what regiment in three windows rattling in a table now heard anything .  but felt already 
gone so dark for my pet whose aid of god upon on an illegitimate son shall drive you wish you about anything looked and when 
opportunity now always eats his last days bogucharovo and no thought independent existence he rode so now that's twue devil mack 
and though not at midday they danced daniel ulyulyuing were quite out when trying said what natasha's eyes meeting bagration's 
colloquies with our brave men left without offending mary returned home alone did me everything coexisting with all made expeditions 
and with black horses kept increasing fog singing waving her a whisper behind still farther movement got to a different firm 
resolution not feel like father whom could hear .  anatole and have sent envoys demanding now we'll take offense immediately dropped 
his head coachman this and some precious object for and smiled almost with her about himself what more distinguished important 
posts formed to look back and now necessary preparations and sat plunged into prince vasili's two decorations and left wing 
especially attracted general bonaparte having stumbled over bolkonski had been transferred .  these difficult because by the latter 
having written that my enemies to carry off of me ah well then footsteps or someone on he exclaimed princess rose up more is 
difficult .  here exclaimed with one direction rose to put myself with whom do in human minds roam but an impression but seeing in these 
i held only son would fall for everyone turned outwards but a dream said smiling birch tree can tell one's shoulders back so far as 
clear daylight of what regiment to an advanced post stood but all made in on till anatole's departure from every evening goes he 
took poleon himself in full light up between love letter of your future is our salvation .  again quarreled said you it long since left

something down by bennigsen rather late one spoke great difficulty of the captain asked you remember these movements prince returned 
to him feel this unknown quantity of prisoners he glanced ironically without my pipe to show to know himself whether telling .  
here is no thought a cossack made remarks as ever lay between her .  even if something fresh .  even bonaparte will hear of

<p>You may be noticing that the obfuscated version can be significantly longer than the original data.  This is an unfortunate side effect, but it can be helped in some cases using compression before the data is obfuscated.  The compression method used doesn&rsquo;t really matter, as long as it is the same on both sides.  Additionally, if the transport method being used supports compression, ASCII text tends to compress quite well.</p>

<h2 id="use-cases:84e7421e24ba41f3bed9835a932084c9">Use Cases</h2>

<p>There are quite a few use cases for this that come to mind.  The first is the method it was developed to prove, exfiltrating data past a firewall.  Considering that the obfuscated data is text, it could even be sent out in emails without triggering an alert based on content, written to a Google Drive document, or simply POSTed via HTTP.  Similarly, it could be a simple command and control channel, as it would be very simple to POST data to an HTTP/IRC/etc server and receive a response.</p>

<p>This could potentially be used to obfuscate other communication channels as well.  For instance, a method like this could be a positive addition to instant messaging plugin such as OTR, as it could hide the fact that there were encrypted communications.  Due to recent world events, and not wishing to support radical movements even indirectly, I won&rsquo;t be releasing such plugin or improvement, and hoping that they suck even worse at coding than they do at hacking.</p>

<h2 id="detection:84e7421e24ba41f3bed9835a932084c9">Detection</h2>

<p>Detecting this method could be considerably difficult.  Much like most other issues on the blue team side of things, the greatest issue is related to detecting something at scale.  From a network firewall perspective, there would need to be parsing of all text, which would then need to be statistically analyzed and compared to Markov language models to see if the data strongly fit.  To be absolutely honest, it would require someone with considerably more skill than myself in machine learning (like any one of the actual data scientists at Cylance) in order to handle this kind of detection at scale without a significant number of false positives and false negatives. I do wish I had a better answer to detect this method, but right now, I do not.</p>

<h2 id="code:84e7421e24ba41f3bed9835a932084c9">Code</h2>
